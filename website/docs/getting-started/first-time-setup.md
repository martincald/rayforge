# First Time Setup

After installing Rayforge, you'll need to configure your laser cutter or
engraver. This guide walks you through creating your first machine with the
configuration wizard and establishing a connection.

## Step 1: Launch Rayforge

Start Rayforge from your application menu or by running `rayforge` in a
terminal. You should see the main interface with an empty canvas.

## Step 2: Create a Machine with the Wizard

Navigate to **Settings → Machines** or press <kbd>ctrl+comma</kbd> to open
the settings dialog, then select the **Machines** page.

Click **Add Machine** to open the machine picker.

![Add Machine Dialog](/screenshots/app-settings-machines-add.png)

The configuration wizard opens and adapts which steps it shows to your
choices:

- Picking a **built-in profile** pre-fills the controller, work area, and
  head — the wizard skips straight to the rotary, camera, and review steps
- **Importing a profile** keeps the hardware and head steps so you can
  correct anything the import got wrong
- **Device Not Listed** walks you through every step, including the
  controller and AI-spec-lookup steps

### Pick a Starting Point

Choose a built-in device profile to pre-fill the controller, work area, and
head settings, or click **Device Not Listed** to configure everything
manually. You can also **Import from File…** a previously exported profile
or a LightBurn device profile (.lbdev) with camera calibration and laser
settings.

### Choose a Controller

Pick the firmware or protocol family that matches your machine's controller
board (GRBL, Marlin, Smoothie, Ruida, OctoPrint, …). Choose
**None — G-code export only** if you only want to export G-code to files and
never drive a physical machine. This step is skipped when you start from a
built-in profile or an import.

### Connection

Enter the connection parameters your machine requires. The exact fields
depend on the controller you chose:

- **Serial drivers** — USB device path (e.g. `/dev/ttyUSB0` on Linux,
  `COM3` on Windows) and baud rate
- **Network drivers** — host address and port (e.g. `192.168.1.100`)
- **OctoPrint** — server URL and API key

### Discover the Device

When your controller supports it, the wizard offers to connect to the device
and read its configuration automatically — work area, speeds, acceleration,
and firmware capabilities. Click **Probe Now** to auto-detect these values,
or use **Next** to enter them by hand in the following steps.

### AI Provider

Shown only when no AI provider is configured yet. Enter an OpenAI-compatible
endpoint (base URL and API key) so the next step can look up specifications
for known commercial machines. Skip this step to enter the values by hand.

![Wizard — AI Provider](/screenshots/config-wizard-ai-provider.png)

### AI Spec Lookup

If your machine is a known commercial model, the AI can pre-fill its
specifications from the manufacturer's documentation. Enter the vendor and
model, then click **Look Up Specs**. Suggested values appear as switch rows
and start accepted — turn off anything you don't want applied.

![Wizard — AI Spec Lookup](/screenshots/config-wizard-ai-lookup.png)

### Hardware

Configure the machine's physical setup:

- **Axes** — X/Y work-area extents and the coordinate origin (0,0) corner
- **Axis direction** — reverse an axis if coordinates come out negative
- **Work Area** — margins around the unusable space of the work surface
- **Soft Limits** — optional safety bounds for jogging
- **Speeds** — max travel speed, max cut speed, and acceleration
- **Behavior** — home on start and single-axis homing

![Wizard — Hardware](/screenshots/config-wizard-hardware.png)

### Head

Declare what's attached to the gantry — a laser or a spindle head — and set
its parameters. For a laser: max power (S-value), spot size, PWM frequency,
and focal distance. For a spindle: max and min RPM.

![Wizard — Head](/screenshots/config-wizard-head.png)

### Rotary Module

Optionally set up a rotary attachment: type (jaws or rollers), axis (A/B/C),
mode (true 4th axis vs. axis replacement), geometry, and reverse-direction
flag. Skip this step to add a rotary module later from machine settings.

![Wizard — Rotary Module](/screenshots/config-wizard-rotary.png)

### Cameras

Optionally enable any cameras you want to use for preview and alignment.
When you enable a camera and continue, the camera
wizard opens to guide you
through image settings, lens calibration, and image alignment. You can skip
this and set up cameras later from the machine's camera settings.

![Wizard — Cameras](/screenshots/config-wizard-camera.png)

### Review & Name

Give the machine a name and review a summary of everything you've configured
— driver, connection, work area, speeds, heads, rotary modules, and cameras.
The wizard also surfaces any warnings, such as a missing driver or an unset
work area.

![Wizard — Review & Name](/screenshots/config-wizard-review.png)

Click **Create Machine** to finalize. The Machine Settings dialog opens for
your new machine, where you can adjust any of the settings the wizard
pre-filled. See the [Machine Setup](../machine/general.md) pages for details.

## Step 3: Automatic Connection

Rayforge automatically connects to your machine when the application starts
(if the machine is powered on and connected). You don't need to manually
click a connect button.

The connection status is displayed in the bottom-left corner of the main
window with a status icon and label showing the current state (Connected,
Connecting, Disconnected, Error, etc.).

:::success Connected!
If your machine shows "Connected" status, you're ready to start using Rayforge!

## Troubleshooting Connection Issues

### Device Not Found

- **Linux (Serial)**: Add your user to the `dialout` group. This is required
  for **both Snap and non-Snap installations** on Debian-based distributions
  to avoid AppArmor DENIED messages:
  ```bash
  sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
  ```
  Log out and back in for changes to take effect.

- **Snap Package**: In addition to the `dialout` group above, ensure you've
  granted serial port permissions:
  ```bash
  sudo snap connect rayforge:serial-port
  ```

- **Windows**: Check Device Manager to confirm the device is recognized and
  note the COM port number.

### Connection Refused

- Verify the IP address and port number are correct
- Ensure your machine is powered on and connected to the network
- Check firewall settings if using network connection

### Machine Not Responding

- Try a different baud rate (some devices use `9600` or `57600`)
- Check for loose cables or poor connections
- Power cycle your laser cutter and try again
